Exercise 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Taking name in a variable

let personName: string = "muhaMMad kamraN ali rana"; 

// this will change name to lower case
let lowercaseName: string = personName.toLowerCase();

// this will change it to upper case
let uppercaseName: string = personName.toUpperCase();

// this will split the name from spaces into array of and will store it into array name: words

let words: string[] =personName.split(" ");

// here taking an empty string
let titleCaseName: string = ""

for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
     titleCaseName += words[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1).toLowerCase() + " "
    };
// here is result

console.log(lowercaseName);
console.log(uppercaseName);
